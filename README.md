## Project Description

UniNotes is an online platform for sharing and managing notes for university students. It allows users to upload, search, and share academic notes organized by semester and course.

## Technologies

  - .NET 9.0
  - Blazor
  - MongoDB
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Installation and Execution Instructions

### Prerequisites

  - .NET 9.0 SDK
  - MongoDB (locally or on a cloud service)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UniNotes.git
    cd UniNotes
    ```

2.  **Setup MongoDB**

      - Create an account on MongoDB Atlas or install MongoDB locally
      - Create a new database for UniNotes

3.  **Configure AppSettings**

      - Create an `appsettings.json` file or rename `appsettings.template.json` to `appsettings.json` in the main project folder (UniNotes/)
      - Use the template below, replacing `<CONNECTION_STRING>` with your MongoDB connection string and `<WEBHOOK_URL>` with your Discord Webhook URLs:

    <!-- end list -->

    ```json
     {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
         "MongoDb": "<CONNECTION_STRING>"
     },
     "Logging": {
         "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
         }
     },
     "AllowedHosts": "*",
     "DiscordWebhook": {
         "ReportUrl": "<WEBHOOK_URL>",
         "SecretaryUrl": "<WEBHOOK_URL>"
         }
     }
    ```

    **Note**: Some versions of Visual Studio create this file automatically, but for users outside of Windows or on other IDEs, it is necessary to create it manually. This file is not included in the repository for security reasons.

4.  **Install Dependencies and Run**

    ```
    dotnet restore
    dotnet run
    ```

5.  **Access the Application**

      - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5073` or `https://localhost:7073`
